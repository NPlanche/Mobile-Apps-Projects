## Overview
### Description
Music App, where users can create a personal account to explore/discover tracks, artist and albums top on the area and world wide, at the same time search for tracks listen to their previews, look for artist and albums, and being able to create and edit their own personalized playlist with their selected tracks.

### App Evaluation
- **Category: Music**
- **Mobile: For application being mobile is essential in the sense that we will be dealing user information extraction using their location, for example, top songs or albums in their area or country. Another reason for mobile is the integration of working with a mobile app in the sense of playing previews of songs and easy traversal through multiple songs in a playlist from the user.**
- **Story: Users will be able have an easy access to popular songs and artists around their location, this could help users discover new songs and artists to listen to with simplicity.**
- **Market: With the growing number of people using streaming services to listen to music, listening to music is more than a norm nowadays. This app will be useful for many people in the sense that it will allow users to see songs and artists that they listen to in said streaming services.**
- **Habit: Any individual can make an account with our app. Users who would use this app are users who frequently listen to music. The use of the app would depend on how much users want to explore the music that they prefer to listen to. This app will encourage users to go and explore songs and artists with an endless limit.**
- **Scope: The basic structure of the app at the end that we wish to have seems to be manageable in the sense that will have an app that does the same functionalities like displaying and retreiving information from the music industry. It will be interesting to show this basic structure as we are able to show live data that can be changed from the user or other users. Having this basic structure alone gives us a clear vision of what we want for the app and if the time permits shoot for a more traversel application.**

## Product Spec

### 1. User Stories (Required and Optional)
To kick off this session, we want to list out the things a user can do within our app, and tag them as “must-have” (required) or “nice-to-have” (optional)

**Required Must-have Stories**
For NotraMuse, we identified the following “must-have” features which a user needs to be able to perform for the app to work:
